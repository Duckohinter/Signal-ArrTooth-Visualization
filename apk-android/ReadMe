workable apps that can be downloaded and installed on android. Corresponds to the .aia projects, built on MIT app inventor.
Useful for visualizing 

User interface
The app has three main interactive parts
  Home, here you can 
    Establish a connection with a known, transmitting bluetooth unit
    Navigate to Settings and Home
  Settings, here you can
    Change visualization parameters such as 	
      Timespan (how many data points are visualized, horizontal window)
      Lower and upper bound (vertical scale and shift of data to the window)  
    If there are several sensors, you can switch between which you are visualizing. 
    Navigate to Plot and Home
  Plot, here you can
    Look at an online data plot
    Navigate to Settings and Home
    
 There are two different conventions used for separating bytes textmessages between arduino and app, 
 either "<x\n" or "<x>" where x is the sent byte. 
 TransmitTextDataViaBt version 1 uses the older "<x>" , whilst versions 2 and 3 uses the newer "<x\n".
 The apps speedLimit and NopeWasSomethingWithCircuit uses "<x\n", whilst workingAppNowOntoHigherResolution uses "<>". 
 Please take care of these conventions when pairing app and arduino codes. 

While receiving data, the app also writes the data to a .csv file in downloads called arduinoData with the month and day : MMM_d.
